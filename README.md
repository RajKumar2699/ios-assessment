the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern is well-suited.

MVVM provides a clear separation of concerns and supports data binding, which can simplify the implementation of the user interface and handle the dynamic nature of the options and exclusions. Here's how the components of MVVM can be utilized in this project:

Model: Represents the data structures and business logic. In this case, it would include the facility and option data, as well as the exclusion rules.

View: Represents the user interface. It would include the UI elements such as table views, cells, and controls to display the facilities and options.

ViewModel: Acts as an intermediary between the model and view. It provides the necessary data and logic to populate the view, handle user interactions, and enforce exclusion rules. The ViewModel would observe the selected options and update the view accordingly, and also validate and enforce the exclusion conditions.

With MVVM, you can bind the ViewModel properties to the UI elements using data binding frameworks like SwiftUI or RxSwift, which can simplify the code and keep it reactive to changes in the ViewModel.

Overall, MVVM provides a structured and organized approach to handle the complex UI requirements, data binding, and business logic in a maintainable and testable manner. It allows for easier extension, customization, and separation of concerns.
